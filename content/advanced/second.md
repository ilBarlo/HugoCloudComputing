# Introduction
IPDK is an open-source development framework, community-driven and target- agnostic which runs on CPU, IPU, DPU or switch. The main maintainer is Intel but also other companies are implied like Marvell, Ericsson, etc. What IPDK does is create an abstraction level between the target and the implementation to offload and manage infrastructures that run on different targets. Under the hood, it uses a few well-established linux frameworks like SPDK, DPDK and P4.

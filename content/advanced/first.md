## What is an IPU?
In a typical “server optimized” enterprise data center, systems are designed for use by a single party, that is, the enterprise itself. However, in a CSP (Communications Service Providers) cloud data center, the workload is owned by the tenant, while the systems themselves are owned by the Service Provider.
Further, in highly virtualized environments, significant amounts of server resource are expended processing tasks beyond user applications, such as hy- pervisors, container engines, network and storage functions, security, and vast amounts of network traffic.
To address this challenge Intel has introduced a new class of product called the IPU. An IPU is an advanced networking device with hardened accelerators and Ethernet connectivity that accelerates and manages infrastructure func- tions using tightly coupled, dedicated, programmable cores. An IPU offers full infrastructure offload and provides an extra layer of security by serving as a control point of the host for running infrastructure applications. By using an IPU, the overhead associated with running infrastructure tasks can be offloaded from the server.
